# SkylineShotsWebsite

My first take on Skyline Shots, my drone content page.

I started off the initial coding projects in Code Pen due to me working away from home, the iniitial draft consisted of mainly the html, wherein i added the main header for the page, followed by all the subheadings and the call to actions.

As i decided to base this page of my own personal content and brand, i used my brand name, slogan and my own images and ensured to change the font family on the page to bree serif.

I created the navigation links under the headers and ensured to create more navigation links at the bottom of the page above the footer.

In CSS i tried including my logo on the page but it continuosly ended up completely blowing up covering the entire page so i stopped pursuing this endeavour, instead settling on making my header font big and presentable, as well as adding opacity to the background colour of the header.

I tried using the media min width to make the page more mobile friendly as the header was too big in mobile view but i struggled with this.
